{% for item in context %}
{{ item }}
{% endfor %}

{% endif %}

What will you add to the project if you want to extend it?
Ask {{ num_of_questions }} {{ "question" if  num_of_questions==1 else "questions" }} from AI to add new artifact to the PROJECT.
You can ask to create new API, Sequence, Endpoint, Proxy service, Inbound Endpoints, Message Processor, Message Store, tasks, Local Entry or Data service.
